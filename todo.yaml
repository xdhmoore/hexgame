todos:
  - code:
    - [ ] make screencell move when arrow keys are pressed
      - [ ] alter screencell to map input arrow keys to correct hex-space direction
  - dev environment:
    - [ ] something's wack with git status keep sshowing perm changes
    - [ ] something's wack with git status keep showing file whitespace changes
    - [ ] fix having to set git username and email every time. this should already be being copied from host when docker container is created. maybe create minimum reproducible example
    - [ ] integrate black:
      - [ ] terminal?
      - [ ] vs code - see isort ext page
        - [x] added
        - [ ] test
    - [ ] integrate pylint:
      - [ ] terminal
      - [ ] vs code
    - [ ] integrate any other vscode plugins, possibly user-specific (not in git):
      - [ ] editorconfig?
      - [x] todo tree
      - [ ] isort?
      - [ ] intellicode?
      - [ ] intellicode api usage examples?

someday maybe:
  - make a kubernetes cluster for everything
  - integrate with gradle to build
  - separate out front end from backend using a rest api, maybe using python microservices framework
  - make a new front end with react (svg? webgl? webgl next?)
  - play someone else over a network using websockets
  - make engine for running large numbers of simulations of the game
