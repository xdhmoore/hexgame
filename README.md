## Hexgame

Will eventually be a clone of the game [Hive](https://gen42.com/games/hive). Very much a work in progress.

### Dev Setup

Docker must be running. Then when you open the root folder in VS Code, it should give you a popup asking if you want to reopen it in a container. Say yes.

There is a launch configuration defined for running the game. It doesn't do much currently.

You can also run the tests by running `pytest` in the root folder from the terminal or via VS Code's python testing functionality.
